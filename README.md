Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death in the world. According to the
GlobalBurden of Disease Study in India, it contributes to nearly 25% of all fatalities. With the
growing number of heart diseases, especially among the youth, there is an increased need for
awareness of cardiovascular diseases and their management. This alarming statistic drives
home the fact that one is more likely to die of a heart attack than a road accident. The
Phonocardiogram (PCG) is a straightforward and cost-effective diagnostic tool for heart sound
examination. We can classify underlying cardiovascular diseases by using these signals
extracted by the Phonocardiogram and analyzing them with computer-aided detection
technology.
This model is of the following stages: Pre-processing, Feature extraction, Classification, and
Evaluation. In the first stage, the signals are sampled to 2k hertz. Here we are obtaining training
and validation datasets from Physio net challenge 2016. The database from the website contains
nearly 4,430 sound recordings from 1,072 subjects, for a total of 233,512 sounds from all kinds
of patients. The extraction of a few significant temporal and frequency features with around 21
features will be processed. Following the classification of these characteristics using the
mentioned methods, we analyze our validation signal dataset using these models. Using
decision trees, regression models, support vector machine (SVM) models, and other machine
learning classification approaches, this paper's main objective is to offer a method for
categorizing normal and pathological heart sound recordings.
